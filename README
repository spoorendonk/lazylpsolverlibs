LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS README
=======================

OVERVIEW
========
lazylpsolverlibs provides libraries that can replace at link time those of
commercial lp solvers, and that act as runtime as these libraries (if they
can be found on the system). It has been designed to make the packagers
life easier.

PROJECT PAGE
============
lazylpsolverlibs is hosted at https://code.google.com/p/lazylpsolverlibs/

DEPENDENCIES
============
- gmodule-2.0
- glib-2.0

INSTALLATION
============
autoreconf -i
./configure --with-pic --enable-static
make
make install

BUILDING THE WINDOWS VERSION
============================
You need mingw32. Install it, then find out the path of the compiler, and
modify share/package.sh according to your needs

INSTALLING THE WINDOWS VERSION
==============================
For example, to test with glpk:
- Install glpk from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/glpk.htm
  (using the setup link, "Complete package, except sources") It will
  normally install itself to Program Files\GnuWin32
- You also need gmodule-2.0 (in glib). The easiest way to get it is to
  download the all-in-one bundle on http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
  Extract it to C:\Program Files\GnuWin32
- Now install lazylpsolverlibs through the setup file, and try to run
  lazyglpk-config.exe: It should tell you that it succesfully solved a
  problem.

TESTING
=======
You must have the related solver. Run:
    lazycplex-config
    lazyglpk-config
    lazygurobi-config
    lazyxprs-config

USING
=====
Instead of linking to cplex/xpress/gurobi/glpk, link to the related
lazylpsolverlib library. You now have a program that is not linked to
cplex/xpress/gurobi/glpk. You may distribute this program easily, and a
new user will be able to use it without recompiling, just by setting a
symlink or an environment variable.
